      2.1 Quality Inspection

           </span>

      Check whether the products’ size is consistent with the promotional materials.

    </div>
    <div>
      It should be noted that when the product is more than 95% (less than 2 differences between product and promotional picture) same with the promotional image, we consider it qualified.
